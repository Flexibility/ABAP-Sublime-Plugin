ABAP-Sublime-Plugin
===================

Description: **ABAP Syntax Highlighter for Sublime Text 2**

How to install it?
------------------
Extract all files from zip archive into the folder: *c:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\ABAP\*

 - *1st note:* It is necessary to create "ABAP" folder under "Packages" folder manualy.
 - *2nd note:* If the file you are editing has *.abp* extension, syntax highlighting works automaticaly. Otherwise you have to set the ABAP syntax explicitely (click on the bottom right corner in the ST2 window a choose ABAP).
 - *3rd note:* If nothing works, restart ST2!

What you can do with ABAP plugin
--------------------------------
 - highlight ABAP syntax (keywords, system contstants, name of forms, classes, methods and modules)
 - auto-complete code (it works both keyword suggesting and the snippets)
 - speed up coding with the set of predefined snippets (of course it's very easy to create your owns)
 - get overview of forms, classes, methods and modules on *Ctrl+R* command
 - comment/uncomment selected blocks of code on *Ctrl+/* command

Recommendation
--------------
I prefer the color scheme **Zenburn** to achieve the best results. 
You can install it either by *Package Control*: Press Shift+Ctrl+P -> write *Package Control: Install Package* [Enter] -> write *Zenburn* [Enter]) 
or manualy (download it from https://github.com/colinta/zenburn).
