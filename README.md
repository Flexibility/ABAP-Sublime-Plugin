Recommendation
--------------
I prefer the color scheme **Zenburnesque** to achieve the best results. 
You can install it either by *Package Control*: Press Shift+Ctrl+P -> write *Package Control: Install Package* [Enter] -> write *Zenburnesque* [Enter]) 
or manualy (download it from https://github.com/colinta/zenburn).
